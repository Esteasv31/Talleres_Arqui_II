## Along with this README file, there should be two .c source codes named "max_vector.c" and "mult_matrix.c".

### max.c

#### Calculate the maximum number from each column in a 2x8 matrix.
#### Each value from the matrix will be introduced by the user and the result will be printed on the terminal.

#### To compile the source code use:

> $gcc -o <output> max.c -msse4.1

#### where <output> is the name of the executable file.

### mult.c

#### Calculate the matrix multiplication between two 4x4 matrix.
#### The inputs and result will be printed on terminal.

#### To compile the source code use:

> $gcc -o <output> mult.c -msse4.1

#### where <output> is the name of the executable file.
